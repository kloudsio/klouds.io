**Today (Friday, May 1) I was sharpening my tools & refactoring**

So **webpack** is a giant configuration nightmare. Browser auto-refresh config makes it worse. Oh god.
When I started this project, I was using **gulp**, **webpack**, **bower** and **webpack-****loaders**.
It took probably 10 hours to get it configured to work, and the configuration problems persisted;
Well: **babeljs**, **duo**, just took me 1-2 hours today, and much more powerful.
plus I accomplished toggle components via **d3js**.
this goes to show why being framework agnostic wins. If I had been using something like React..
that would be a dirty job, if I even knew how (frameworks might keep people noob)
babeljs gives me ES6. io.js, and koa are cool because of ---> Generators.
This gives me an excellent tool to cut down dev time and complexity


# What is next?


 1. Test if duo compiled my front-end correctly.
 2. User Registration Button
 3. App Purchase Notifies Us
 4. Activate the Payment Buttons (manual deployment)
 5. Rancher Integration ??

      misc: blockchainery, pricing, app dashboard, app config, dockerizing, marketplace, subscriptions,
        user profiles, ux/ui/design, and much much more :)
